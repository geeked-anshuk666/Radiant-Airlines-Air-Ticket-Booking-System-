generate Full php program for the 3rd functionality.
Sure, here is a sample PHP program that demonstrates the functionality of canceling a flight booking:

Copy code
<?php

// Connect to the database
$db = mysqli_connect("host", "username", "password", "dbname");

if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Retrieve form data
    $bookingId = $_POST["booking-id"];
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    $name = $_POST["name"];

    // Delete the booking from the database
    $query = "DELETE FROM bookings WHERE id='$bookingId' and email='$email' and name='$name'";
    mysqli_query($db, $query);

    // Get the flight ID from the booking
    $query = "SELECT flight_id FROM bookings WHERE id='$bookingId'";
    $result = mysqli_query($db, $query);
    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
    $flightId = $row['flight_id'];

    // Update the seats_available in the flight table
    $query = "UPDATE flights SET seats_available = seats_available + 1 WHERE id = '$flightId'";
    mysqli_query($db, $query);

    // Close the database connection
    mysqli_close($db);
}

// Render the cancellation confirmation page
include("header.php");
include("cancellation-confirmation.php");
include("footer.php");
This script is getting the data of the booking which you want to cancel (booking id, email, and name) then deletes the booking data from the bookings table and updates the flight table in terms of available seats by incrementing the available seats by 1.
After that, it renders the cancellation confirmation page.

As with the code I provided before, please note that this is a sample code and may need to be adapted to match the structure of your database and other specific requirements of your project.
Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.

generate cancellation-confirmation.php program.
Sure, here is a sample code of how you could display the cancellation confirmation to the user:

Copy code
<?php
if(isset($bookingId)){
    // Display cancellation confirmation
    echo "Your flight booking has been canceled. Your booking ID is: " . $bookingId . "<br>";
    echo "We have sent a cancellation confirmation to " . $email . "<br>";
    echo "Thank you for using our service.";
}
else{
    // Handle error
    echo "Error: Invalid booking ID or Email";
}
?>
This code snippet is displaying the cancellation confirmation to the user. It is checking if the $bookingId variable is set, if so it will display a message with the booking ID, cancellation confirmation message, and a thank you note for using the service, if the variable isn't set, it would display an error message "Error: Invalid booking ID or Email".

This code is a sample, you may want to adjust it according to the design and message you want to show after a user cancels their booking.
Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
