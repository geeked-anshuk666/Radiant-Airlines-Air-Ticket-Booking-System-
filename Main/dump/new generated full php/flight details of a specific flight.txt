generate full php program for the 5th functionality

2 / 2

Sure, here is a sample PHP program that demonstrates the functionality of displaying flight details of a specific flight:

Copy code
<?php
// Connect to the database
$db = mysqli_connect("host", "username", "password", "dbname");

// Get the flight ID
$flightId = $_GET["flight_id"];

// Query the database for the flight details
$query = "SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id='$flightId'";
$result = mysqli_query($db, $query);

// If there is a result, store it in a variable
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    $flight = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
} else {
    $message = "No flight found with this ID.";
}

// Close the database connection
mysqli_close($db);

// Render the flight details page
include("header.php");
include("flight-details.php");
include("footer.php");
This script is getting the flight id from the user by '$_GET' method, then it queries the database to retrieve the flight details based on the id, the results will be stored in a variable called $flight. If no flight was found with that id, an error message will be displayed.

Then it renders the flight-details page.

This code is assuming that you have a flights table in your database, and you're passing the flight id as a get parameter in the url like this ?flight_id=3
You'll have to tweak the code to match your database structure and other requirements of your project.
Please let me know if you have any question or if there's anything else I can help with.

generate flight-details.php program.
Sure, here is a sample code of how you could display the flight details:

Copy code
<?php
if(isset($flight)){
    // Display flight details
    echo "Flight ID: " . $flight['id'] . "<br>";
    echo "Departure City: " . $flight['departure_city'] . "<br>";
    echo "Arrival City: " . $flight['arrival_city'] . "<br>";
    echo "Departure Time: " . $flight['departure_time'] . "<br>";
    echo "Arrival Time: " . $flight['arrival_time'] . "<br>";
    echo "Price: " . $flight['price'] . "<br>";
    echo "Seats Available: " . $flight['seats_available'] . "<br>";
} else {
    // Handle error
    echo "No flight found with this ID.";
}
?>
This code snippet is displaying the details of a flight. It is checking if the $flight variable is set, if so it will display the flight's details in a readable format, the flight details are extracted using the array keys like id, departure city, arrival city and so on. If the variable isn't set, it would display an error message "No flight found with this ID."

Please note that this is a sample code, and you may want to adjust it according to the design and message you want to show after a user requests the flight details.
