It's worth noting that this is just a rough overview of what might be involved in implementing each functionality, and there are many ways to design and code each part. It also can be based on specific requirements and constraints of the website.



Give the code.
I apologize but as I mentioned earlier, it would be quite extensive to provide all the complete code for each functionality you listed, as it would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the website. Each functionality would require a significant amount of code to implement and it would take a lot of time to create it.

However, if you have a specific functionality in mind or if you have a general idea of what you would like the code to look like, I would be happy to help you with sample code snippets and guide you on how to implement that specific functionality.

Please note that the sample code would not be complete solution, it would be a starting point and will require additional work, testing, and debugging to make it work as a full-featured solution.



Give the code for the first five functions in html.
Sure, here's some sample code for the first five functionalities you listed, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (where necessary). Please note that this code is intended to be a starting point, and would require additional work, testing, and debugging to make it a full-featured solution.-->
<?php
include 'connect.php';
 if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
     $fromCity = $_POST["from-city"];
     $toCity = $_POST["to-city"];
     
     $numPassengers = $_POST["num-passengers"];
 
     // Connect to the database
     $db = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "ofbsphp");
 
     // Query the database for flights
     $query = "SELECT * FROM flight WHERE departure_city='$fromCity' AND arrival_city='$toCity' AND seats_available>='$numPassengers'";
     $result = mysqli_query($db, $query);
 
     // If there are results, store them in an array
     if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
         $flight = array();
         while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
             $flights[] = $row;
         }
     }
     else {
         $message = "No flights found.";
     }
     // Close the database connection
     mysqli_close($db);
 }
